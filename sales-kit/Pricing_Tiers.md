# Proxian Stack — Protocol Naming Primitive Pricing

Premium **acronym-native domains** designed to become infrastructure standards (like ENS, ERC-20, or NFT).  
*Not keywords — patented linguistic primitives for the next era of decentralized identity and ownership.*

---

**Ideal for:** Founders building in identity, licensing, or delegated execution.  
**Includes:**
- One .com domain from the Proxian stack:
  - VOIDsProtocol.com *(Volatile Ownership Identity Deeds)*
  - SOULsLicense.com *(Smart Ownership & Utility Licenses)*
  - ProxianOrder.com *(PROXY-enabled execution layer)*
- Exclusive rights to the acronym’s technical definition and branding
- GitHub README co-sign (optional)
- *Add-on:* 30-min positioning consult (+0.5 ETH)

*(Limited to 3 buyers per domain; 1.5 ETH for pre-launch teams)*

## 🌐 Tier 3 — Full Stack Acquisition

**Ideal for:** Investors or foundations standardizing a vertical.  
**Includes:**
- All 3 core domains (VOIDs + SOULs + ProxianOrder)

  - Trademark filings (US/EU)
  - Glyph/logo licensing
  - Developer docs (forkable)

## Key Differentiators
1. Linguistic Moats — Acronyms like “VOIDs” are defensible IP, not generic terms.  
2. Turnkey Protocol Positioning — Domains come pre-loaded with technical narratives.  
3. Pipeline Priority — Buyers get early access to Proxian’s partner integrations.
