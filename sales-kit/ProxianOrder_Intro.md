**Delegation as a Primitive**  
The programmable control layer for digital sovereignty systems.

## What is the Proxian Order?

The **Proxian Order** is the control architecture that governs VOIDs (ownership) and SOULs (identity).  
It introduces **PROXY** â€” the missing primitive in Web3:  
> **Programmable Representation of Ownership & Xecution by Your agent**

Just as DAOs enabled shared governance, **PROXYs** enable trusted, revocable execution by delegated agents, oracles, or smart systems.

## Core Functions of PROXY

- **Delegate tasks** to agents, bots, or AI models  
- **Revocation and permission logic** tied to SOUL identity  
- **Autonomous execution layer** for asset actions or governance calls

Example:
```solidity
proxy.execute(taskId, agent, soul);
